# About

There has been an increasing number of large, high-severity wildfires across the Western United States. It is not fully understood how this intensification may impact conifer forests of the West, whose resilience is dependent on successful seedling regeneration. It is important to understand how these forests are able to recolonize high-severity burn patches and subsequently respond to these shifting disturbance regimes. The goal of this research is to characterize the 30-year recovery trajectory and spatial pattern of conifer regeneration within high-severity burn patches. We investigated 35 high-severity wildfire complexes that occurred between 1988 and 1991 in conifer-dominated ecosystems of the northern Rocky Mountains. Composite snow-cover Landsat imagery was utilized to isolate conifer-specific vegetation and diminish spectral contributions from deciduous vegetation. Conifer regeneration was determined to be initially detectable by Landsat approximately 10-years post-fire using these methods. The presence of conifer regeneration was then modeled at 3-year intervals post-fire to characterize the progression of recolonization. The trajectory of snow-cover Landsat NDVI was utilized to estimate recovery time to pre-fire vegetation conditions for Douglas-fir, Fir-Spruce, and lodgepole pine forests. Ongoing analysis will determine the level of regeneration cover in a Landsat pixel for detection and characterize how spatial patterns of colonization vary across burn patch size and species. This work will provide insights into the ecological processes of conifer regeneration and may be applied to support forest restoration decision making following high-severity wildfire.
